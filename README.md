## About Us
*“Phirse paisa khatam ho gaya. Abh Tara Ma aagli mahine.”*<br>
-Student, VIT<br><br>

Isn't this something we all know and face. The primary objective of this project is to aid the users to keep a track of their day to day expenses. Students, more often than not, turn out to frivolous spenders. It is of utmost importance to keep an account of where the money is being spent, how much of it is being spent and is it more than the median amount. Enter **MyKhata**.
